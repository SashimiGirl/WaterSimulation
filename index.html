<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p> <b>Summary</b>: We are using point mass (small circles in OpenGL) to represent small collections of water molecules.
  We have created overarching objects that hold attributes for physical objects. This will be used to help
  control the interactions between the water and other objects in our scene. We will do equivalents in 3D
  and then follow up with 3D physics, gravity, and consider the new frame of reference for our hopeful
  final executable with a tipping bucket of water.<br/> <br/>

  <b>Preliminary Results</b>: We managed to switch from the deprecated GLU/GLUT libraries in the given Particle class
  to GLAD as our loader and created an executable file.
  We then took steps to learn OpenGL and its rendering specifics/methods and created a simulation of
  blue water particles as blue circles with natural variation.<br/> <br/>

  <b>Status Check</b>: This first step to switch to GLAD for the load caused many more troubles than anticipated
  to understand it (did not find good documentation for it and what to do after getting our glad.c).
  As a result, we are slightly behind our original plans, but feel like this will follow more naturally
  than understanding loading libraries, for example. <br/> <br/>

  <b>Updated Plans</b>: We will complete interactions between molecules, both water-water and water-mesh, in 2D
  and then extend this to 3D in the following two days (we have substantially thought and planned out the data structures and a BVH to do this).
  We will then follow this with creating our environment and static objects/meshes such as a rubber duck
  or a water container. This will follow in the next two-three days. <br/> <br/>

  Finally, we will then see if this is efficiently viable and then consider optimizations such as those
  discussed in class to render faster.
